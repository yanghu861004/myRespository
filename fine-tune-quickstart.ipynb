The baristas are friendly and while I was here, a lot of regulars must have come in, because they bantered away with almost everyone.  The bathroom was clean and well maintained and the trash wasn't overflowing in the canisters around the store.  The pastries looked fresh, but I didn't partake.  The noise level was also at a nice working level - not too loud, music just barely audible.\\\\n\\\\nI do wish there was more seating.  It is nice that this location has a counter at the end of the bar for sole workers, but it doesn't replace more tables.  I'm sure this isn't as much of a problem in the summer when there's the space outside.\\\\n\\\\nThere was a treat receipt promo going on, but the barista didn't tell me about it, which I found odd.  Usually when they have promos like that going on, they ask everyone if they want their receipt to come back later in the day to claim whatever the offer is.  Today it was one of their new pastries for $1, I know in the summer they do $2 grande iced drinks with that morning's receipt.\\\\n\\\\nOverall, nice working or socializing environment.  Very friendly and inviting.  It's what I've come to expect from Starbucks, so points for consistency.\"}"

The quality of all of the food was very good, especially considering the fact that they have such a large variety.  As you walk into the buffet area you are greeted with a large assortment of sushi (both nigiri and various rolls).  I passed on these and headed to the pile of crab legs lurking behind the sushi bar.  They split the crab legs so that they are easier to eat, which is a plus.  No need to waste precious buffet time cracking open a bunch of crab legs!  Also along the way you will find traditional American cuisine such as mashed potatoes and prime rib, along with other ethnic delights such as grape leaves and Chinese specialties.  Among the surprises was the beef wellington, which is not found at most other buffets.  It melts in your mouth.  The desserts leave something to the imagination and better ones can be found elsewhere.  But an excellent place to enjoy a nice meal if you can justify the cost.</td>\n",

The live band relies heavily on a keyboard and they are very mediocre. \\n\\nThe crowd is older and generally very affluent.

I had a plane to catch at 3pm today and I was debating if I should miss my flight so I can enjoy my meal at Studio B. Alas, we knew it was impossible. In the end, we came upon a strip mall and decided to eat fast food. It was a choice between Dickey's and Buffalo Wild Wings. Instantaneously, we chose Dickey's, only because we just had Buffalo Wild Wings recently.\\n\\nWalking into Dicky's, we realized that we probably picked the right choice because it was super packed!\\n\\nThis was another casual restaurant. The first thing I did was get in line. While in line, I checked out the big blown out menu. There were a lot to choose from.  I ended up with the Big BBQ Sandwich combo with 2 sides ($7). \\n\\nNow, my order didn't end there. I now gotta order the type of meat. There were a lot of meats to choose from and I ended up with the beef brisket. As for the sides, I added waffle fries and fried onions. I also added a side of fried okra to my order. The total bill came out to be $9.19 ($1.50 for the third side, plus tax).\\n\\nThe condiments were at the self serve station. At the station, you can get unlimited dill pickles and BBQ sauces. There were 3 kinds of sauces:\\n\\n1. Dicky's special sauce\\n2. Sweet BBQ sauce\\n3. Spicy BBQ sauce\\n\\nOverall, the sauces pretty much taste the same. The only difference was the flavor of the sauce being more bold, spicy, or sweet.\\n\\nThe brisket itself was ok. It was lacking flavor and it wasn't tender. The sides definitely made up for this. \\n\\nOverall my experience here was ok. I came to the conclusion that the reason why this place was packed was because the patrons were just like me: we couldn't make it in time for the buffet at M Resort!\\n\\nTip: The Big BBQ Sandwich itself costs $5, BUT on Mondays, it is only $1 !!!!</td>\n",

No need for any further descriptives.  \\n\\nThe secret to the sandwich is the bread: thickly sliced Mancini's bread.  Rumor has it that Primanti's opened a location in Florida.  It didn't do very well because they weren't able to get the Mancini's.  There you go.  My favorite version of the Primanti's is the steak and cheese.  It's a beef patty and cheese (not sliced beef as in a cheese steak).  This is the only thing I will eat tabasco on.  Fresh, thick cut fries and mild vinegar based cole slaw.

       "      <td>(3.5 stars)\\n\\nMandalay Bay's Fleur de Lys (an offshoot of the Michelin Star SF restaurant) has been re-imagined as Fleur By Hubert Keller (with a move from fine dining to tapas style).  I am not sure why they made the change.  Maybe it was due to the economy and they wanted to provide something less expensive and more approachable.\\n\\nI never visited Fleur de Lys, but the decor seems similar.  Contemporary room with a warm feel.  High ceilings provide an open feel.  There is enough spacing between the tables to make conversation easy.  The wall still has the Fleur de Lys' wall decor (stones and rose decoration).  They have swapped out the white tablecloth for simple lacquered wood tables.\\n\\nWe tried several dishes, which were all well presented.  While most (if not all) of the dishes were probably cooked and tasted okay, they were not very memorable.  Also, the portions were dainty (even for tapas) so the food felt a little pricey.  Here is a rundown on what we tried.\\n\\n(Cheese Platter - 4.5 stars) One of the best cheese dishes I've had.  They had a great assortment of cheeses that ranged in flavor and texture (including a pungent cheese that was presented in delicate ruffled layers like exotic mushroom petals).  Good toasts (including a sweet fruit and nut toast).  There were also good garnishes including honey, a fruit paste and a grape salad (that actually looked a lot better than it tasted).\\n\\n(Tiramisu - 4 stars) The tiramisu was good--nice cream, good coffee flavor and good ladyfingers.  Simple but satisfying.  The dessert was served with biscotti, which was just okay.\\n\\n(Tuna Tacos - 4 stars) These little crunchy tacos featured raw tuna, jalapeno, lime cilantro, and cabbage.  Good flavor, fresh and nice contrasting textures.  It was good but would not be among the best tuna dishes I've had.\\n\\n(Peking Duck - 3.5 stars) The duck breast was served with sauteed greens, caramelized pearl onions and date puree.  The flavors were mostly sweet and good; the greens did provide a little bitterness.  The duck was pink and juicy though not the best quality; the skin could have been more crisp.\\n\\n(Skirt Steak Topped With Chimchurri, Fingerling Baked Potato And Heirloom Tomato Salad - 3.5 stars) The heirloom tomato salad was fresh and was dressed in a vibrant vinaigrette.  The very tiny fingerling baked potato was topped with creme fraiche and chives.  It was okay, but when something is that small and cute, it needs to be great.  The skirt steak was juicy and tasty.\\n\\n(Yukon Gold Potato &amp; Veal Ravioli - 3.5 stars) The pasta was very thin (almost translucent) and looked like Asian dumplings.  The inside veal filling was okay but not great.  It tasted pretty good though.  It was served with Tallegio cheese, which had a great flavor.\\n\\n(Panna Cotta With Berries Compote And Sorbet - 3 stars) The vanilla panna cotta was creamy and light, but it was overwhelmed by the heavy topping of strong and tart berries.  The sorbet was a little too icy.\\n\\n(Foie Gras Mousse With Huckleberry Gelee - 3 stars) The cold foie gras mousse was served in a glass and was topped with a gelee of sweet huckleberry (and accompanied by brioche toasts).  Good mix of salty and sweet but nothing spectacular.\\n\\n(Hummus And Baba Ganoush - 2.5 stars) One of the dips had a strong garlic flavor (can't remember which one).  Served with pita bread.  Okay but pretty standard stuff.\\n\\n(Angus Sliders With Red Onion, Cheese And Pear - 2.5 stars) The sliders featured juicy meat and good housemade buns.  There was too much onion though; it was overpowering.  There was a little bit of thin matchstick fries, which were just okay.\\n\\n(Chocolate Souffle With Chocolate Ganache And Mango Ice Cream - 2.5 stars) The chocolate souffle looked great.  Great rise and a nice design (fleur) on top.  The souffle was not right though--it was way too spongy.  Also, the chocolate ganache tasted burnt.  The ice cream was creamy and good.\\n\\n(Cheesecake Lollipops - 2 stars) These firm cheesecake lollipops were decorated with graham crackers and chocolate.  They looked good, but they were just okay.\\n\\n(Salt Cod Fritters - 2 stars) These lightly breaded hush puppies did not have a great fish center--mostly bread.  The outside was kind of soft.  While the fritters were not bland, they had a pretty boring flavor.  The romesco dipping sauce was thick and did not improve the dish.\\n\\nService was very good.  Great staff with many friendly, polite and attentive team members.\\n\\nIf Fleur was a little cheaper and the portions were bigger, I would have liked it more.  The food was decent, but if the food tasted as good as it looked, I would have walked away much more satisfied.  Still, Fleur was significantly better than the other Vegas tapas spot I tried--Julian Serrano at Aria.\\n\\nLocated in Mandalay Bay, parking is complimentary (valet or self-parking structure).</td>\n",
